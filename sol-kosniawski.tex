\parbf{7.13(c).}
\textit{Prove that the graph of the function $f\: [0,1] \to \RR$ is compact if and
only if f is continuous.
Give an example of a discontinuous function
$g: [0,1] \to \RR$ with a graph which is closed but not compact.}

\parit{Solution.}
Denote the graph of $f$ by $\Gamma$.

\parit{If part.}
Assume $f$ is continuous.

Note that $F\:x\mapsto (x,f(x))$ is a continuous function $[0,1]\to\RR^2$.
Since $[0,1]$ is compact, so is its $F$-image which is $\Gamma$.


\parit{Only-if part.}
Assume $\Gamma$ is compact.
By Theorem 3.3 (page 17 in Kosniowski's book), it is sufficient to show that $f^{-1}(Q)$ is closed for any closed $Q\subset \RR$.
Note that $P=(\RR\times Q)\cap\Gamma$ is closed.
Since $\Gamma$ is compact, so it $P$.

Observe that $f^{-1}(Q)$ is the projection of $P$ to the first coordinate.
Since $P$ is compact, the same holds for its image $f^{-1}(Q)$.
Finally, since $f^{-1}(Q)$ compact subset of real line, it is has to be closed (\ref{ex:closed-compact}).

\parit{Example.}
\[g(x)=
\begin{cases}
\tfrac1x&\text{if}\quad x\ne0,
\\
0&\text{if}\quad x=0.
\end{cases}
\]
