\section{Definitions}

A subset of topological space is called \emph{clopen} if it is closed and open at the same time.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
A topological space $\c{X}$ is called \emph{connected} if it has exactly two clopen sets $\emptyset$ and the whole space $\c{X}$.
\end{thm}

According to our definition, the empty space is not connected.
Not everyone agrees with this convention.

Suppose $V$ is a \emph{proper} clopen subset in a topological space $\c{X}$; that is, $V\ne\emptyset$ and $V\ne\c{X}$.
Note that its complement $W=\c{X}\setminus V$ is also a proper clopen subset.
In particular, there are two open sets $V,W\subset \c{X}$ such that $V\ne\emptyset$, $W\ne\emptyset$, $V\cup W=\c{X}$ and $V\cap W=\emptyset$.
In this case, the pair $V$ and $W$ is called \emph{open subdivision} of $\c{X}$.
Note that a nonempty space is disconnected if and only if it admits an open subdivision. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:image-connected}
Let $f\:\c{X}\to \c{Y}$ be a continuous onto map between topological spaces.
If $\c{X}$ is connected, then so is $\c{Y}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We can assume that $\c{X}$, and therefore $\c{Y}$ are nonempty.

Assume the contrary; that is, $\c{Y}$ is disconnected.
Suppose $V$ and $W$ form an open subdivision of $\c{Y}$.

Since $f$ is continuous, $V'=f^{-1}(V)$ and $W'=f^{-1}(W)$ are open in $\c{X}$.
Since the map $f$ is onto $V'\ne\emptyset$ and $W'\ne\emptyset$.
Finally observe that $V'\cup W'=f^{-1}(\c{Y}) =\c{X}$ and
\begin{align*}
V'\cup W'&=f^{-1}(V\cup W)=f^{-1}(\c{Y})=\c{X},
\\
V'\cap W'&=f^{-1}(V\cap W)=f^{-1}(\emptyset)=\emptyset.
\end{align*}
That is, $V'$ and $W'$ is an open subdivision of $\c{X}$; 
therefore $\c{X}$ is disconnected --- a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:quotient-connected}
Let $\c{X}$ be a connsected space.
Show that the quotient space $\c{X}/{\sim}$ is connected for any equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\c{X}$.
\end{thm}

A subset of topological space is called the connected or disconnected if so is the corresponding subspace.
Spelling the notion of subspace we get the following definition.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\c{X}$ be a topological space.

A subset $A\subset \c{X}$ is called \emph{disconnected} if it is empty or there are two disjoint open sets $V$ and $W$ in $\c{X}$ such that 
\[V\cap A\ne\emptyset,\quad W\cap A\ne\emptyset,\quad\text{and}\quad V\cup W\supset A.\]

Otherwise, we say that $A$ is \emph{connected}.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:union-connect}
Assume $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\c{I}}$ is a collection of connected subsets of a topological space.
Suppose that  $\bigcap_\alpha A_\alpha\ne\emptyset$.
Then 
\[A=\bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha\] 
is connected.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary; that is, $A$ is disconnected.
Choose its open subdivision $V$, $W$.
Since $\bigcap_\alpha A_\alpha\ne\emptyset$, we can fix $p\in \bigcap_\alpha A_\alpha$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $p\in V$.

In particular, $V\cap A_\alpha\ne\emptyset$ for any $\alpha$.
Since $A_\alpha$ is connected, it follows that $W\cap A_\alpha=\emptyset $ for each $\alpha$.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
W\cap A&=W\cap\biggl(\bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha\biggr)
\\&=\bigcup_\alpha(W\cap A_\alpha)
\\&=\emptyset,
\end{align*}
a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:A<B<bar-A}
Let $A$ be a connected set in a topological space $\c{X}$.
Suppose that $A\subset B\subset \bar A$.
Show that $B$ is connected.
\end{thm}


\section{Real interval}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:connected[0,1]}
The real interval $[0,1]$ is connected.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary;
let $V$ and $W$ be an open subdivision of $[0,1]$.
Fix a $a_0\in V$ and $b_0\in W$;
without loss of generality, we can assume that $a_0<b_0$.

Let us construct a nested sequence of closed intervals 
\[[a_0,b_0]\supset [a_1,b_1]\dots\]
such that $b_n-a_n=\tfrac1{2^n}(b_0-a_0)$ and 
\[a_n\in V\quad\text{and}\quad b_n\in W
\eqlbl{eq:ab-in-VW}\]
for any $n$.

The construction is recursive.
Assume $[a_{n-1},b_{n-1}]$ is already constructed.
Set $c=\tfrac12\cdot(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})$.
If $c\in V$,
then set $a_{n}=c$ and $b_{n}=b_{n-1}$;
if $c\in W$, then set $a_{n}=a_{n-1}$ and $b_{n}=c$.
In both cases, \ref{eq:ab-in-VW} holds.

The sequence $a_n$ is nondecreasing and bounded above by $b_0$.
In particular, the sequence $a_n$ converges; denote its limit by $x$.
Since $b_n-a_n=\tfrac1{2^n}\cdot(b_0-a_0)$, the sequence $b_n$ also converges to $x$.

The point $x$ has to belong to $V$ or $W$.
Since both $V$ and $W$ are open, one of them contains $a_n$ and $b_n$ for all large $n$ --- a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:R-connected}
Show that the real line $\RR$ is a connected space. 
\end{thm}

\section{Connected components}

Let $x$ be a point in a topological space $\c{X}$.
The intersection of all clopen sets containing $x$ is called \emph{connected component} of $x$.
Note that the space $\c{X}$ is connected if $\c{X}$ is the connected component of one (and therefore any) point in $\c{X}$.

As an intersection of closed sets,
any connected component has to be closed.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:nonopen-connected-component}
Construct an example of topological space $\c{X}$ and a point $x\in \c{X}$ such that the connected component of $x$ is not open.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:finite-number-connected-component}
Suppose that a space $\c{X}$ has a finite number of connected components.
Show that each connected component of $\c{X}$ is open.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:connected-component-disjoint}
Show that two connected components either coincide or disjoint.
In other words, being in one connected component defines an equivalence relation on points of topological space.
\end{thm}



\section{Cut points}

Evidently, number of connected components is a topological invariant;
that is, \textit{if two spaces are homeomorphic, then they have the same number of connected components}.
In particular, connected space is not homeomorphic to a disconnected space.

Let us describe a more refined way to apply this observation.
Suppose $\c{X}$ is a connected space, a point $x \in\c{X}$ is called a \emph{cut point} if removing $x$ from $\c{X}$ produces a disconnected space $\c{X}\setminus\{x\}$.

Note that if $f\:\c{X}\to \c{Y}$ is a homeomorphism, then a point $x \in\c{X}$ is a cut point of $\c{X}$ if and only if $y=f(x)$ is a cut point of $\c{Y}$.
Indeed, the restriction of $f$ defines a homeomorphism $\c{X}\setminus\{x\}\to \c{Y}\setminus\{y\}$.
In particular, we get that the spaces $\c{X}\setminus\{x\}$ and $\c{Y}\setminus\{y\}$ have the same number of connected components.

These observations can be used to solve the following exercises.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:S1ne[0,1]}
Show that the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ is not homeomorphic to the line segment $[0,1]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:R2neR}
Show that the plane $\RR^2$ is not homeomorphic to the real line $\RR$.
\end{thm}
{

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:not-homeo}
Show that no two of the following four closed connected sets in the plane are not homeomorphic.
(Each set is a union of line segments.)
