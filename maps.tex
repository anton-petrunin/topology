\section{Homeomorphisms}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:homeo}
A bijection $f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$ between topological spaces 
is called \emph{homeomorphism} if $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}\:\c{Y}\to\c{X}$
are continuous.%
\footnote{The term \emph{homomorphism} from abstract algebra looks similar and it has similar meaning but should not to be confused with \emph{homeomorphism}.}

Topological spaces $\c{X}$ and $\c{Y}$ are called \emph{homeomorphic} (briefly, $\c{X}\simeq\c{Y}$) if there is a homeomorphism $f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Give an example of continuous bijection between topological spaces that is \emph{not} a homeomorphism.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that $x\mapsto e^x$ is a homeomorphism $\RR\to (0,\infty)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Construct a homeomorphism $f\:\RR\to (0,1)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that $\simeq$ is an equivalence relation;
that is, for any topological spaces $\c{X}$, $\c{Y}$, and $\c{Z}$ we have the following:
\begin{subthm}{}
$\c{X}\simeq\c{X}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
if $\c{X}\simeq\c{Y}$, then $\c{Y}\simeq\c{X}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
if $\c{X}\simeq\c{Y}$ and $\c{Y}\simeq\c{Z}$, then $\c{X}\simeq\c{Z}$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Prove that the complement of a circle in the Euclidean space is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space without line $\ell$ and a point $p\not\in\ell$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Any nonempty open star-shaped set in the plane is homeomorphic to the open disc.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Show that the complements of two countable dense subsets of the plane are homeomorphic.
\end{thm}

\section{Closed and open maps}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:open-closed-maps}
A function between topological spaces 
$f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$ is called \emph{open} if, for any open set $V$ in $\c{X}$, the image $f(V)$ is open in~$\c{Y}$.

A function between topological spaces 
$f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$ is called \emph{closed} if, for any open set $V$ in $\c{X}$, the image $f(V)$ is closed in $\c{Y}$.
\end{thm}

Note that homeomorphism can be defined as a \emph{continuous open bijection}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that a bijective map between topological spaces is closed if and only if it is open.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Give an example of a map $f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$ between two topological spaces such that 
\begin{subthm}{}
$f$ is continuous and open, but not closed,
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
$f$ is continuous and closed, but not open,
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
$f$ is closed and open, but not continuous.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Construct two functions $\RR\to\RR$, one is closed but not continuous, and the other is open but not continuous.
\end{thm}
