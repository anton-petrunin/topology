\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:proper-jordan}
Suppose $\Gamma\subset\RR^2$ is a closed set homeomorphic to $\RR$.
Then $\RR^2\backslash \Gamma$ has at least two connected components.
\end{thm}

We will use the following two auxiliary propositions.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:c/sc}
Suppose $\Gamma\subset\RR^2$ is a closed set such that the complement $X=\RR^2\backslash \Gamma$ is connected.
Let us identify $\RR^2$ with the $(x,y)$-plane in $\RR^3$.
Then the complement $Y=\RR^3\backslash \Gamma$ is simply-connected.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sc-VuW}
Suppose that $V$ and $W$ are open simply connected subsets of topological space $\c{X}$ such that 
$\c{X}=V\cup W$, and the set $V\cap W$ is path-connected.
Show that $\c{X}$ is simply-connected.

Conclude that sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ is simply-connected.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $A$ (respectively $B$) the sets that include $\Gamma$ and the points below (respectively above) $\Gamma$;
that is,
\begin{align*}
A&=\set{(x,y,z)}{(x,y)\in\Gamma\ \text{and}\ z\le 0},
\\
B&=\set{(x,y,z)}{(x,y)\in\Gamma\ \text{and}\ z\ge 0}.
\end{align*}
Consider their complements $V=\RR^3\backslash A$ and $W=\RR^3\backslash B$.
Note that $Y=V\cup W$.

The sets $V$ and $W$ are simply-connected.
Indeed, the horizontal plane $z= 1$ is a deformation retract of $V$;
a retraction can be defined by $(x,y,z)\mapsto (x,y,1)$ and the following homotopy shows that it is homotopic to the identity map: 
\[h_t(x,y,z)=(x,y,(1-t)\cdot z+t).\]
The plane is contractible, in particular simply-connected; therefore so is $V$.
Similarly one proves that $W$ is simply-connected.


Since $X$ is open and connected set in $\RR^2$.
By \ref{thm:open-connected=path-connected}, $X$ is path-connected.
Further, note that $V\cup W=X\times \RR$.
Therefore $V\cup W$ is path-connected as well.

Summarizing, $V$ and $W$ are open simply-connected sets, $Y=V\z\cup W$, and $V\z\cap W$ is path-connected.
Applying \ref{ex:sc-VuW}, we get that $Y$ is simply connected.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:home-gamma-z-axis}
Suppose $\Gamma\subset\RR^2$ is a closed subset homeomorphic to $\RR$.
Then there is a homeomorphism $\RR^3\to \RR^3$ that maps $\Gamma$ the $z$-axis.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $t\mapsto (a(t),b(t))$ be a homeomorphism $\RR\to \Gamma$.
By Tietze--Urysohn extension theorem (\ref{ex:tietze}), there is a function $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$ such that 
$f(a(t),b(t))=t$ for any $t\in \RR$.

Note that the map 
\[F\:(x,y,z)\mapsto (x,y,z+f(x,y))\] is a homeomorphism.
Indeed, this map is continuous and its inverse 
\[F^{-1}\:(x,y,z)\z\mapsto (x,y,z-f(x,y))\]
is continuous as well.

Similarly, the map 
\[G\:(x,y,z)\mapsto (x-a(z),y-b(z),z)\]
is a homeomorphism as well.
Indeed, $G$ is continuous and it has inverse 
\[G^{-1}\:(x,y,z)\mapsto (x+a(z),y+b(z),z)\]
that is continuous as well.

It follows that the composition $G\circ F\:\RR^3\to\RR^3$ is a homeomorphism.
Observe that $G\circ F(a(t),b(t),0)=(0,0,t)$.
It follows that $G\circ F$ sends $\Gamma$ to the $z$-axis as required.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that the complement of the $z$-axis in $\RR^3$ is not simply connected.

Combine this statement together with \ref{prop:c/sc} and \ref{prop:home-gamma-z-axis} implies \ref{thm:proper-jordan}.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $J\subset\mathbb{S}^2$ be a subset homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^1$.
Then $\mathbb{S}^2\backslash J$ has at least two connected components. 
\end{thm}

This theorem is a partial case of famous Jordan's theorem;
it is known for simple formulation and annoyingly tricky proofs.

\parit{Proof.}
Remove a point $p$ from $J$ to get a closed line $\Gamma=J\backslash\{p\}$ in $ \mathbb{S}^2\backslash\{p\}\simeq\RR^2$.
It remains to apply \ref{thm:proper-jordan}.
