\section{Contractible spaces}

A topological space $\c{X}$ is called \emph{contactable} if the identity map $\id_\c{X}\:\c{X}\z\to \c{X}$ is homotopic to a constant map;
that is, there is a homotopy $h_t\:\c{X}\to\c{X}$ such that $h_0(x)=x$ and $h_1(x)=p$ for some fixed point $p\in\c{X}$ and any $t$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that any convex subset of the Euclidean space is contractible.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that any contractible space is path-connected.
\end{thm}

Later we will show that the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ is an example of path-connected space that is not contractible.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\c{X}$ be a contractible space.

\begin{subthm}{}
Show that any two continuous maps from a topological space to $\c{X}$ are homotopic.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
Show that any two continuous maps from $\c{X}$ to a path-connected space are homotopic.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\section{Homotopy type}

Two topological spaces $\c{X}$ and $\c{Y}$ have the \emph{same homotopy type} (briefly $\c{X}\sim\c{Y}$) if there are continuous maps
$f\: \c{X}\to \c{Y}$ and $h\:\c{Y}\to \c{X}$ such that $h\circ f\sim \id_\c{X}$ and $f\circ h\sim \id_\c{Y}$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that a topological $\c{X}$ is contractible if and only if it has the same homotopy type with the one-point space.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $A$ is a strong deformation retract of a space $\c{X}$.
Show that $A$ and $\c{X}$ have the same homotopy type.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that the following two closed connected sets in the plane have the same homotopy type.
(Each set is a union of line segments.)
