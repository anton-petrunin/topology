\section{Closed sets}

Let $\c{X}$ be a topological space. 

A set $K\subset \c{X}$ is called \emph{closed} if its complement $\c{X}\backslash K$ is open.

From the definition of topological spaces the following properties of closed sets follow.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:closed-properties}
Let $\c{X}$ be a topological space. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item The empty set and $\c{X}$ are closed.
\item The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.
That is, if $K_\alpha$ is open for any $\alpha$ in the index set $\c{I}$,
then the set
\[L=\bigcap_{\alpha\in \c{I}} K_\alpha
=
\set{x\in \c{X}}{x\in K_\alpha\quad\text{for any}\quad\alpha\in \c{I}}\]
is closed
\item\label{def:top-space:n} 
The union of two closed sets (or any finite collection of closed sets) is closed.  
That is,  if $K_1$ and $K_2$ are closed then the union $L=K_1 \cup K_2$ is closed. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

The definitions of open and closed sets are mirrow-symmetric to each other.
There is no particular reason why we define topological space using open sets --- we could use closed sets instead.

Sometimes it is easier to use closed sets; 
for example, the cofinite topology can be defined by declaring that the whole space and all its finite sets are closed.

The following proposition is completely analogous to the original definition of continuous functions via open sets (\ref{def:cont-top}). 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:cont-closed}
Let $\c{X}$ and $\c{Y}$ be topological spaces.
A function $f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$ is continuous if and only if any closed set $K$ has closed inverse image $f^{-1}(K)$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
In the proof we will use following set-theoretical identity.

Suppose $A\subset \c{Y}$ and $B=\c{Y}\backslash A$ (equvalently  $A=\c{Y}\backslash B$).
Then
$$f^{-1}(B)
=
\c{X}\backslash f^{-1}(A)\eqlbl{eq:inverse-image-complement}$$
for any function $f\:\c{X}\to\c{Y}$.
This identity is tautological,
to prove it observe that both sides can be spelled as 
\[\set{x\in\c{X}}{f(x)\notin A}.\]

\parit{``Only-if'' part.}
Let $B\subset \c{Y}$ be a closed set.
Then $A=\c{Y}\backslash B$ is open.
Since $f$ is continuous, 
$f^{-1}(A)$ is open.
By \ref{eq:inverse-image-complement},
$f^{-1}(B)$ is the complement of $f^{-1}(A)$ in $\c{X}$.
Hence $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed.

\parit{``If'' part.}
Fix an open set $B$, its complement $A=\c{Y}\backslash B$ is closed.
Therefore $f^{-1}(A)$ is closed.
By \ref{eq:inverse-image-complement},
$f^{-1}(B)$ is a complement of $f^{-1}(A)$  in $\c{X}$. 
Hence $f^{-1}(B)$ is open.

The statement follows since $B$ is an arbitrary open set.

\section{Interior and closure}

Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset in a topological space $\c{X}$.
The union of all open subsets of $A$ is called the \emph{interior} of $A$ and denoted as $\mathring A$.

Note that $\mathring A$ is open.
Indeed, it is defined as a union of open sets and such union has to be open by definition of topology (\ref{def:top-space}).
So we can say that $\mathring A$ is the \emph{maximal} open set in $A$, 
as any open subset of $A$ lies in~$\mathring A$.

In a similar fashion, we define closure.
The intersection of all closed subsets containing $A$ is called the \emph{closure} of $A$ and denoted as $\bar A$.

The set $\bar A$ is closed.
Indeed, it is defined as an intersection of closed sets and such intersection has to be closed by Proposition~\ref{prop:closed-properties}.
In other words, $\bar A$ is the minimal closed set that contains $A$, 
as any closed subset of $A$ contains $\bar A$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $A$ is a subset of a topological space $\c{X}$;
consider its complement $B=\c{X}\backslash A$.
Show that 
\[\bar B=\c{X}\backslash \mathring A.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that the following holds for any set $A$ of a topological space:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\mathring A\subset A\subset \bar A$
\item $\bar{\bar A}=\bar A$ 
\item $\mathring{\mathring A}=\mathring A$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{Boundary}

Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset in a topological space $\c{X}$.
The complement $\bar A\backslash \mathring A$ is called the \emph{boundary} of $A$ and dented as $\partial A$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that the boundary of any set is closed.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that the set $A$ is closed if and only if $\partial A\subset A$.
\end{thm}

\section{Neighborhoods}

Let $x$ be a point in a topological space $\c{X}$.
A \emph{neighborhood} of $x$ is any open set $U$ containing $x$.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $A$ be a set in a topological space $\c{X}$.
Show that $x\in \partial A$ if and only if any neighborhood of $x$ contains points in $A$ and its complement $\c{X}\backslash A$. 
\end{thm}
